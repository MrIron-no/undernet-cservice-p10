 Undernet's Channel Service Information                         
This is the Undernet Channel Service written by Robin Thellend
aka SeKs <intru@step.polymtl.ca>.

A registered channel is under the responsibility of its channel
manager who has full control over it.  To register a channel,
complete the registration that can be found at
http://cservice.undernet.org/regist/ and follow the instructions.

It is also recommended that you read the Channel Service Committee
Guidelines before sending in an application.  This will explain the
process of registering a channel with the Undernet Channel Service.

The guidelines are available on the WWW at
http://cservice.undernet.org/ and by FTP at
ftp://ftp.undernet.org/pub/irc/docs/X/CSC-guidelines

They are also available from Undernet IRC by:
/msg HelpBot get CSC-guidelines

The number of channels one can register is currently limited to one 
channel per person.  Registration takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete.
