adduser gives the given access to anyone matching mask.
nick is only used as a reference and should be the nickname the
person uses to most. If nick is online, mask is not necessary,
and the userhost will be looked up automatically.  If default user
flags are defined (see help set), those flags are used.

modinfo is used to modify an entry in the userlist. field can
be either of the followings: MATCH, ACCESS, AUTOOP, PASSWORD.
new value must be ON or OFF for field AUTOOP, or other
valid values for the other fields.

remuser removes the access of the given user.
