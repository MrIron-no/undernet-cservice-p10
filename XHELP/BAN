SYNTAX: ban [channel] <nick|n!u@h> [duration] [level] [reason]
        unban [channel] <nick|n!u@h>
        cleanbanlist

ban adds an entry to the 'banlist'. If channel is supplied,
it is used instead of the current channel. duration specifies how
long the entry should remain in the list (in hours). level is an
integer ranging from 0 to your access level on the channel. reason
is not mandatory and can be up to 80 characters long.

The effect of this command depends on the level supplied:
	  level 	| effect                          
	  >= 20		| user is not allowed to be chanop
	  >= 75		| user is not allowed to be on the
			| channel at all.
Intermediate levels are used internally to manage warnings.

unban removes a ban from the banlist.

cleanbanlist purges expired entries from the banlist. This should
be handled automatically, so this command should only be used as a
debug tool.
