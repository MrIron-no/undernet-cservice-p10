This is the undernet channel service help package.

To install it, execute this command in your home
directory:
     tar zxf Xhelp.tgz
OR,  gzip -cd < Xhelp.tgz | tar xf

Then, you only have to load the file ~/XHELP/Xscript
in your IRC session. The easiest way to do it is to
add it in your .ircrc with this command:

    echo "//LOAD ~/XHELP/Xscript" >> ~/.ircrc

Make sure you type both '>'. Otherwise, your .ircrc
file will be lost.

To install it for your whole system, uncompress the
archive in your IRCLIB directory, edit the Xscript
file so XHELP_DIR points to the correct directory and
add the proper /LOAD in your script/local.

This package is likely to require updates.
The latest version of this package is always
available from:
  ftp://ca.undernet.org/pub/undernet/X/Xhelp.tgz
