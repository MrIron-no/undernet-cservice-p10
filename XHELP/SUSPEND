SYNTAX: suspend [channel] <nick|address> <duration> [s|m|h|d]
        unsuspend [channel] <nick|address>

The command suspend is used to remove one's access to this service
for a certain time specified with the duration argument. Time units
can be specified for duration (seconds,minutes,hours or days).

When a user is suspended he or she cannot use any command requiring
an access level greater than zero. One can only suspend a user who
has an inferior access than his.

unsuspend removes a suspension (same as suspend with a duration 0)
