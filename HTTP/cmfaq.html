<HR>

<B>IMPORTANT:</B> The channel service bot users an Undernet service called 
Uworld to gain ops on channels. To some scripts/bots (such as Phoenix), 
this is considered a nethack. Please ensure that no one uses nethack 
protection or hack protection scripts. These scripts deop X/W and are 
considered abuse of the Channel service. It is not possible to get ops 
off of a netsplit on Undernet. DO NOT DO ANY "TESTING" WITH X/W. 
If you have questions send mail or drop by #cservice and the Channel 
Service Committee will answer your questions for you.
<P>

<HR><P>

Introduction:  This FAQ is to answer general questions that channel 
managers may have in regards to the Undernet Channel Service (UCS). 
If you don'tknow what the UCS is you should get the Undernet Channel 
Service FAQ fromftp.undernet.org in /pub/irc/docs/cservice. In all
examples, we will assume thatthe channel name is #foo, the nick is 
foobar, the user@host is foo@test.com.For ease of documentation, X 
will be used in all examples, but there are 2 channel service bots, X and W.

<h2>1 - I received my confirmation letter from the Channel Service Committee (CSC), what does this
mean?</h2>
The confirmation letter means you have been added as the channel manager 
of the channel that you applied for. If you are anxious and/or having mail 
problems you can check if your channel has been added by doing a 
/msg x,w chaninfo #channel. This will return a response from both channel 
service bots to say wether your channel has been registered or not. Your 
channel will only be registered on one of the two bots.
<P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="2">
<h2>2 - What are my responsibilities as the channel manager?</h2>
As the channel manager, you are responsible for all activities of your 
channel including its users and bots. It is recommended that you do not 
run other bots on the channel besides X since there is no need for it. X 
will always be there and maintains an oplist. You are also
responsible to ensure that none of your channel operators (including bots) 
are not running hack protection scripts (such as phoenix). You are also to 
ensure that none of your ops deop/kick/ban X. This is considered abuse and 
will be dealt with severly and can result in the removal of X from the 
channel. "Testing", such as seeing what will happen if X is deop'd,
is considered abuse.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="3">
<h2>3 - How does X know that I am the right person.</h2>
The Channel Service Committee has added the IRC address that you specified 
in your application form to the UCS bot X. To check the user@host that 
has been added you can type /msg X access #channel nick. For example: 
/msg X access #foo foobar. If your user@host is not correct contact the 
CSC by sending mail to cservice@undernet.org or drop by #cservice
and ask.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="4">
<h2>4 - So I have access to the the channel, what can I do?</h2>
To find out what commands you have access to do a /msg X showcommands #channel.
It is also a good idea to have a password, just in case someone is using
a hacked username and is able to replicate your user@host name.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="5">
<h2>5 - What do you mean "hacked" user@host?</h2>
Most users with PPP/SLIP access from your site or sites that do not run 
identd can have hacked user@host. This means, the user can select the 
userid of their choice at any time they wish. In general it is a good idea 
to have a password. To setyour password type /msg X newpass password. 
For example to make Foobar's password into FooPass1 it would be
/msg X newpass FooPass1.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="6">
<h2>6 - What happens if I have a password set.</h2>
If you have a password set, X will not recognize you until you send X 
your password (even if you have AutoOp set on. You can identify yourself to 
X using /msg X pass #channel password. For example: /msg X pass #foo FooPass1X 
will return a confirmation message to say that your identification iscorrect.
If you have lost or forgotten your password, contact the CSC and askthem to 
reset it for you. Once you have identified yourself once, you should not have
to do it until you log off of IRC. In some instances of netsplits and the 
rare occurance that X needs to be restarted, you will need to resend your 
password.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="7">
<h2>7 - I have my access, what now?</h2>
First thing you will want to do is move X onto your channel by sending X 
a join message /msg X join #channel. For example: /msg X join #foobar.
To have X leave your channel do a /msg X part #channel. This will not remove
you from the channel service, it will just move X off of the channel. You 
can bring X back at any time by sending the join message.
Now you will want to add your channel to X by /msg X addchan #channel.
For example: /msg X addchan #foobar. This will add #foobar to the list of
channels. This will add your channel to the channel database for X which 
must be done before anything else.Also this will set up all of the channel's 
defaults.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="8">
<h2>8 - What are channel defaults?</h2>
The channel defaults are X modes such as flood protection level, AlwaysOp, 
NoOp, etc... To see what the X settings are for your channel type 
/msg X status #channel.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="9">
<h2>9 - X is on my channel, how do I configure it?</h2>
When X is on the channel you can now configure X for the channel. The 
variables the can be set are: MassDeop, NickFlood, FloodPro, NoOp, and AlwaysOp.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="10">
<h2>10 - What is Massdeop, NickFlood, FloodPro?</h2>
MassDeop is the maximum number of deops one user can do in a 15 second period.
This is an integer value and is set by /msg X set #channel MassDeop #.
For example: /msg X #foo MassDeop 5. NickFlood is the maximum number of 
nick changes one user can do in a 15 second period.
This is an integer value and is set by /msg X set #channel NickFlood #.
For example /msg set #foo NickFlood 5. FloodPro is the limit of TOPIC, MODE, 
and KICKS that one can send to a channel in a 15 secondperiod. This does 
not cover public floods since X is deaf to all public messages to the channel. 
This is an integer value set by /msg X set #channel FloodPro #. For example: 
/msg X #foo Floodpro 20. Any user surpassing the set levels will be kicked 
or deop'd by X.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="11">
<h2>11 - What is NoOp and AlwaysOp mode?</h2>
NoOp is a special mode where X is the only channel operator. This is an 
on/off value that can be set by /msg X set #channel NoOp on/off. AlwaysOp 
is a mode that ensures that X will always be an operator. This canbe set 
with a /msg X set #channel AlwaysOp on/off. The default for NoOp is Off and 
AlwaysOp is On. If a user with access >= 450 deops X, AlwaysOp is turned off 
automatically. If a user with access >= 450 kicks X, AlwaysOp is turned off 
AND a remchan is issued, so X won't rejoin. NoOp mode can only be reset by the
channel manager.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="12">
<h2>12 - How to I add other users to X's oplist?</h2>
To add a user to X's oplist you must be at least a 400 level operator on 
the channel. If you have the correct access, you can addsomeone by
/msg X adduser #channel nick *!*user@host level password.The pasword and 
user@host fields are optional and you may only add someone to a lower level 
than you are. For example, if I am foobar with level 500 (channel manager) 
and I want to add foo2 who's irc address is foo2@my.own.server with a  password 
of foopass I would /msg X adduser #foo foo2 *!*foo2@*.own.server 400 foopass
By placing an extra * in the host name creates a larger host mask that will
cover differnet server names that the user may have. However a *!*@* would
be a really bad entry since that covers all users. Be very careful with your 
use of the * on the userlist.If there are entries that pose a threat to
X it is considered abuse and will be removed and can result in the complete 
removal of X from the channel. If the user is on Undernet at the time that 
you are adding them, X will automatically add the wildcards to the user@host 
if a /msg X adduser #foo nick level format is used.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="13">
<h2>13 - What are the different levels?</h2>
When adding someone you can give any level you wish as long as it is less
than your own and it is a positive integer value. However, a user must
have a certain level to gain certain access.
Level 500 - Channel Manager<BR>
>=450 - Trusted Admins (can remove X from the channel)<BR>
>=400 - List administrator, may add users to the userlist<BR>
>=100 - Channel Operator
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="14">
<h2>14 - How can I see my userlist?</h2>
The user list for the channel can be received by/msg X access #channel * 
the asterix will show all users that have access on the specified channel.
If you want to check a specific users access type /msg X access #channel nick.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="15">
<h2>15 - How can I give someone AUTOOP?</h2>
You can give someone autoops on the channel by adding them to the user list
at any level (that is less than yours) and using the modinfo command.
/msg X modinfo #channelname AUTOOP nick ON
This should get the channel service bot to respond and show you the person's
entry in the database reflecting the change. This also applies to PROTECT.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="16">
<h2>16 - How can I get a second 500 level user?</h2>
In general, there should only be one 500 level user. In some extreme cases 
the CSC will allow a second channel manager. If there was more than one 500 
level user there can be disputes with the 500 level users which will lead 
to problems since all 500 level users have the same access. It is best to 
choose one person to be the channel manager and have that person add the 
others at level 499. The only command that the level 500 person has is the
set command which is rarely used.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="17">
<h2>17 - X used to respond to me, but now it is not, what happend?</h2>
One of three things may be occuring. You may have had your access 
suspended. Your access can be suspended for deop'ing X, attempting to op 
someone that is not allowed to be op'd (banned or suspended user), 
banning/kicking X, etc... To see if you have been suspended type 
/msg x access #channel mynick Your user@host may also be different. Just
/msg x access #channel mynick to check if your access is correct. Thirdly, 
you may need to send X your password if you have one set. If you still 
cannot get X to respond, contact the Channel Service Committee.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="18">
<h2>18 - I can't be on-line 24 hours a day, how will I know if someone is abusing X on my
channel?</h2>
If there is abuse of X and a CSC representative is available, they will join 
the channel and warn the users and answer any questions they might have. If 
the abuse problem is severe (repeated deop's of X), then the channel will 
be placed in NoOp mode and the channel topic will be changed to reflect this. 
Only the channel manager can reset this mode. If you find the channel you 
manage in NoOp mode, you can assume that there was abuse. This is also a 
warning for the channel manager to ensure that their users will not abuse X 
in the future.
<P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="19">
<h2>19 - So is that it?</h2>
No. These are the basics. There are a lot of things in here but there is
still a lot to learn. Managing a channel is not an easy task. Managing
a popular channel is even harder. If you are unsure, please ask.
