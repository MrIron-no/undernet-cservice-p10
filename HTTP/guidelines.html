<H2> History & Ethos of The Channel Service</H2>
 
 Thanks to a lot of work by Seks and the rest of the Undernet IRCops,
 Undernet now has a channel service. This service will allow users to run a
 channel without running a bot. This service replaces the need for a bot on
 a channel.<P> 
 
 This channel service gives the opportunity to users to manage a channel.
 This is *not* ownership because the service will only be placed on the
 channel if that there is a general demand for. It cannot be used in
 channel wars/op wars or in an attempt to end "take over" a channel. 
<P> 
 The Channel Service works the same way that a bot works. It can control
 all channel modes (including ops). One advantage that the service has is
 if ops are lost either due to someone messing up and deop'ing everyone (or
 a flooder/hacker doing it intentionally) then the bot can use Uworld
 (special Undernet service) and regain ops. 
<P> 
 The Channel Service has many different modes. AlwaysOp will ensure that
 the bot always has ops. If ops are ever lost or the bot is unable to join
 the channel then the bot will use Uworld to gain access. NoOp mode will
 make it so the Channel Service is the only Op on the channel. All kicks,
 bans, topic, etc have to be made through the bot. Mode changes still need
 to be done manually. The bot also has flood protection against nick, kick,
 topic and mode changes to ensure that channel flooders are not a problem. 
<P> 
 The Channel Service retains a userlist for every channel that it is
 registered on. The manager of the channel (person who registered the
 channel) controls the list for that particular channel.

<center><h2> Committee Guidelines</h2></center>
<h3> Structure of committee, and general aims</h3>
<DL>
 
   <DD>(i) The Channel Service committee is a sub committee of User-com (Undernet
       user committee).</DD> 
 <DD> (ii) The CSC (Channel Service Committee) are in charge of administrating 
       the channel service</DD>
<DD> (iii) The CSC Will (a) NOT enter into discussions on how a channel is run
                    (b) mediate upon discussions of channel managers.</DD>
<DD>  (iv) The CSC will only register 1 channel per USER (this means user, not 
       account or e-mail address).  This rule may be relaxed at the 
       discretion of the committee for special channels which provide a 
       service, such as help channels.</DD>
</DL> 
<HR><P>
<h3> Committee Procedure</h3>
<DL> 
<DD><h4> Standard Registration:</h4></DD>
<DL>
 
   <DD>(i) Applications are review once per week by the CSC to ensure the
       proper information has been included. A response letter is sent
       to the applicant acknowledging the application when it is
reviewed.</DD>
 
<DD>  (ii) The committee will send a weekly posting to alt.irc.undernet of 
       registration requests, for public viewing.</DD>
 
<DD> (iii) Provided there is no objections the channel service will be moved into 
       place on a trial basis, of 14 days.  After which it will be 
       permanent, subject to the standard review procedures.  The CSC will 
       post an FAQ to the manager.</DD>
 
<DD>  (iv) The CSC will add the channel to the listing of channels that are 
       covered by the Channel service (ftp site ca.undernet.org in 
       pub/undernet) and changes to the document will be posted to cservice 
       on a regular basis.</DD>
</DL> 
<DD><h4> Objections</h4></DD>
<DL> 
   <DD>(i) Users have 14 days in which to make an objection to the Channel 
       Service being placed on a channel</DD>
 
<DD>  (ii) All objections will be considered by the committee.  The CSC chall 
       invoke the following procedures:<BR><DL>
 <DD>      (a) remove the bot from the channel while discussions take
place</DD>
       <DD>(b) attempt mediation between the objectors and the registered
owner.</DD><DL>
            <DD>(i) by trying to put them into contact with each
other</DD>
         <DD>  (ii) by helping if requested to with discussions.</DD>
	</DL>
      <DD> (c) if mediation fails, the BOT will NOT be placed on the Channel.</DD><DL> 
<DD>           - a new application may be made in 2 months, but will not be 
             considered before then.</DD>
<DD>           - the committee will suggest that a channel under a different 
             name be registered.</DD>
</DL></DL></DD> 
<DD> (iii) if an objection is received after that time; the CSC will consider 
       it if:<DL>
<DD>       (a) it is supported by a reasonable number of users (min. 10 - more 
           for larger channels)</DD>
<DD>       (b) has reasonable grounds.
       A valid objection will be dealt with in the same way as for (ii) 
       above; but with the presumption that if the objector cannot 
       substantiate the claim sufficiently, then the bot will
>tay.</DD></DL></DD>
 
<DD>  (iv) The decision of the CSC in all these matters is Final.</DD>

<HR><P>
<h3> Rules:</h3>
<DL> 
   <DD>(i) All e-mail addresses that are used on IRC and at least one mail
       address that the applicant can be reached at should be included. If a
       hacked user@host is used on IRC, a valid mail address is necessary.</DD> 
 
<DD>  (ii) At least 10 supporters are needed for the request to be processed. 
       The supporters need to be included on the application with nick and
       e-mail addresses. </DD>
  
<DD> (iii) Any abuse of the channel service by the channel manager will result
       in the immediate removal of the service. Any abuse of other users will
       result in their refusal of the service to that user. The above includes
       anyone "testing". If testing is required, there is a test network of
       Undernet servers that can be used. If a CSC administrator finds 
       that the Channel Service is being abused in any way, they may remove
       the channel service from the channel immediately and relay any 
       necessary information to other CSC members and contact the manager 
       of the channel immediately with the reason for the removal. The 
       removal will be open to immediate review by the CSC to ensure that 
       the service was abused and to decide if the Channel Service should 
       be returned the channel or not. </DD>
 
<DD>  (iv) Please ensure that channel operators and/or bots on the registered 
       channel are not running netsplit hack protection because they will 
       get into an opwar with X. This is considered abuse and can result in 
       the removal of the channel service. X will always win in an
opwar.</DD>
 
<DD>   (v) The registered channel manager must appear on the channel once every 3 
       weeks.  If the CSC is notified of a prolonged absence a the channel 
 -      managing may be transferred for the intermittant period. Any abuse 
       of the Channel Service done by the temporary channel manager will be 
       both the responsibility of the channel manager and the temporary 
       manager.</DD>
 
<DD> (vi) The Channel Service will be removed from any channel that has low 
      traffic. Channel not being used or only has less than 5 regular 
      users (open to discretion).</DD>
</DL>

 The Channel Service will not be responsible for any activity that occurs
 on the channel. Anything that occurs on the channel are the
 resposibilities of the people involved and has nothing to do with the
 Channel Service, its administrators and the Undernet as a whole, including
 the Operators that run it. The guidelines may change without notice.<P>
