<CENTER><H2>SECTION 1: General UCS/CSC Questions</H2></CENTER>

<A NAME="11"></A><H2>Question 1.1: What is the UCS/CSC?</H2>
The Undernet Channel Service (UCS), aka the Channel Service
Committee (CSC), is the Undernet committee responsible for the registration
of channels and for handling problems with those channels.  It is comprised
of unpaid volunteers who want to help out.<P>

<A NAME="12"></A><H2>Question 1.2: Who owns the UCS/CSC?</H2>
The CSC is not owned by any one person.  It is an organization
chartered by the Undernet administrators, and run by the CSC administrators
(see <A HREF="#17">1.7</A>).  Currently David Low, aka Super, oversees the CSC.<P>

<A NAME="13"></A><H2>Question 1.3: Where is the CSC's office?  What is the CSC's phone number?</H2>
The CSC does not have a physical office or phone number.  Some
helpers and admins can be found in channel #cservice on Undernet.  All
correspondances should be emailed to cservice@undernet.org<P>

<A NAME="14"></A><H2>Question 1.4: Who pays for the CSC?  How does the CSC make a profit?</H2>
The CSC relies solely on the donation of time, disk space, and
services by Undernet administrators.  The CSC helpers and admins are not
paid for their time.  The disk space and computer time to run X/W are
donated by the respective system administrators.  The CSC does not charge
for channel registrations, and therefore does not turn a profit.<P>

<A NAME="15"></A><H2>Question 1.5: How can I become a CSC helper/admin?</H2>
Generally, CSC helpers are people who hang around on #cservice and
help out answering questions.  Trusted helpers are those who have been
around for a while, and are trusted by the admins.  CSC admins are chosen by
the current administrators, usually from the trusted helpers.  If you want
to help out, just join #cservice and start answering questions.<P>

<A NAME="16"></A><H2>Question 1.6: How can I tell if someone really is a CSC helper/admin?</H2>
Trusted helpers and admins can be verified through X/W with one of
the following commands:
 		/msg X verify nickname
			/msg W verify nickname
Sometimes helpers may not be verifiable by this method.  You should then ask
#cservice if they are truly a helper.  If you have the slightest doubt about
someone's claim to be a helper or admin, do not hesitate to check it out.  If
you find that someone is impersonating a CSC admin, please report it to
#cservice.<P>

<A NAME="17"></A><H2>Question 1.7: Who are the admins?</H2>
Currently, the list of CSC admins is as follows: Super, Seks, cowboy,
meredith, Morrissey, Chaos, Teal, jini, Jase, Signe, and AnElf<P>

<HR>
<CENTER><H2>SECTION 2: General X/W Questions</H2></CENTER>

<A NAME="21"></A><H2>Question 2.1: What are X and W?  What do X and W do?</H2>
X and W are the CSC bots, written by Seks.  One of these is assigned
to each registered channel.  For each channel, these bots maintain a
userlist, which specifies who has what access and who should be opped, and a
banlist, which specifies who to ban from joining the channel (or from
getting ops), and for how long.  They are designed to keep a channel open 24
hours a day, and prevent channel takeovers.<P>

<A NAME="22"></A><H2>Question 2.2: How does this differ from any other bot?</H2>
X and W are actually each servers, not just bots.  They are allowed
to work this way because they are run by the Undernet administration.  This
allows them to do several special functions, such as regaining ops if ops
are lost.  Also, each bot is on a large number of channels.  By having one
bot for many channels, this reduces the load on the Undernet network that
would be caused by having one separate bot on each channel.<P>

<A NAME="23"></A><H2>Question 2.3: How do X and W differ from each other?</H2>
There is no difference between X and W as far as the commands and
services availible is concerned.  The only differences are that X and W each
run on separate computer systems and networks, and each one handles a
different list of channels.  The bots are assigned to registered channels at
random.<P>

<A NAME="24"></A><H2>Question 2.4: Why are X/W slow sometimes?  Why do X/W disappear sometimes?</H2>
Just like any other bot or user on Undernet, X and W are subject to
lag and netsplits caused by bad connections between Undernet servers.  This
can cause X and W to slow down drastically (sometimes up to 5 minutes lag),
and even disappear.  If this happens, please be patient.  Be assured that
Undernet and CSC admins are working to get them back to normal as quickly as
possible in the event of a problem.<P>

<A NAME="25"></A><H2>Question 2.5: Why doesn't the CSC put X/W on a better system?</H2>
X and W each require a lot of disk space and computer resources. 
And on top of this, they need to be run on a machine that is an Undernet
server.  Currently, the system administrators of irc.ucdavis.edu
(davis.ca.us.undernet.org) and irc.wildstar.net (okc.ok.us.undernet.org)
are donating the neccessary resources.  While it is possible to move X and
W, it is not feasible, as there is not another system to move one of them to
right now, and moving them involves a lot of time and work.<P>

<HR>
<CENTER><H2>SECTION 3: Registration Information</H2></CENTER>

<A NAME="31"></A><H2>Question 3.1: Why would I want to register my channel?</H2>
Registration not only provides you with the ability to keep your
channel open 24 hours a day, it also gives the channel stability.  In the
case of a channel takeover, the manager always has ultimate control to
regain the channel.  Also, it provides you with a way to have users
auto-op'd, and a more permanent banlist.<P>

<A NAME="32"></A><H2>Question 3.2: What channels can get X/W onto it?</H2>
Almost any Undernet channel can be registered.  The only types of
channels that are currently excluded are warez-type channels, and channels
dealing with child pornography, although the CSC admins do reserve the right
to reject any channel registration for any reason that they deem valid.  Do
not try to change the name of one of these types of channels, or try and
conceal the channel activity, as CSC has many ways of finding out the true
uses of a channel.<P>

<A NAME="33"></A><H2>Question 3.3: How do I get X/W on to a channel?</H2>
To get X/W onto your channel, the channel must be registered.  In
order to do this, you must first have some consensus on the channel as to
who will be the channel manager.  Then you must have 10 supporters. 
Supporters are people who frequent your channel (not neccessarily ops), and
want you to register it.  Once you have these two things, you need to fill
out the registration form, which you can get <A
HREF="/files/X_registration_form.txt">on WWW</A> or on IRC by doing:
"/msg Helpbot get XForm"  Once you have filled out the application, email it
to cservice@undernet.org

<A NAME="34"></A><H2>Question 3.4: Why does the application require supporters?</H2>
Supporters are required because the CSC only registers established,
well used channels.  By requiring supporters, CSC can know that there are at
least 10 people who use this channel.  It also prevents users with malicious
intents from taking over a channel by registering it out from under the true
users of the channel.<P>

<A NAME="35"></A><H2>Question 3.5: Can I have more than one manager?</H2>
The CSC frowns greatly on multiple channel managers.  This is
because in the case of a dispute between channel managers, there is no way
for CSC to mediate.  Multiple managers are only allowed in extreme
circumstances, and to have more than one manager you must petition
cservice@undernet.org with the reasons.<P>

<A NAME="36"></A><H2>Question 3.6: What is the registration process?</H2>
After your registration form is received by the CSC, it is grouped
together with all the applications that come in withing the same 1 or 2 week
span as it.  These are compiled into a pre-registration list which is then
posted to the cservice mailing list, and the alt.irc.undernet newsgroup. 
This is the posting period, and it lasts for 1 week.  During this time CSC
watches for any objections to the registration.  If there are some, they are
evaluated by CSC, and if deemed valid, the registration is rejected.  If
there are no objections, your channel goes into a list of channels waited to
be added to X/W.  At this point you are emailed saying that your
registration has been accepted, and you are also sent a copy of the
manager's FAQ.  Within 1 to 1 1/2 weeks after you receive your acceptance
letter, you channel will be added to X/W, and you may begin configuring
whichever one you are assigned.<P>

<A NAME="37"></A><H2>Question 3.7: Why does registration take so long?</H2>
Every week, there are many registrations to be processed.  Some
weeks there are over 250 applications.  Each of these applications must be
checked for completeness, checked to see if it is already registered, and
then compiled into the pre-registration list.  Then the posting period must
pass, objections must be evaluated, and a final registration list compiled. 
All of this work is done by one CSC admin, who is a volunteer who has other
things to do, such as work or school.  After this final list is compiled, it
must be reviewed by the admins, and then they must make time to add all the
channels, which is a time consuming task.  This is why the registration
process takes so long.<P>

<A NAME="38"></A><H2>Question 3.8: How can I check to see if my channel has been added?</H2>
You can check to see if your channel has been added to X or W by
typing the following commands to check both bots:<UL>
<LI>/msg X chaninfo #yourchannel
<LI>/msg W chaninfo #yourchannel</UL><P>

<A NAME="39"></A><H2>Question 3.9: It's been more than a month since I sent in my application, and I haven't heard anything from CSC, what should I do?</H2>
If you do not hear anything from CSC, one of several things may have
happened:<UL>
<LI>1) Your application may never have arrived, or may have been lost
<LI>2) There could be some backups on registrations causing them to take longer than a month
<LI>3) Your channel could have been rejected and you missed the email telling you this.</UL>
So if a month has passed, and you have not heard anything, your best bet is
to resend your application, and put a note at the top stating that the
application was submitted over a month ago, and you have not heard anything
back from CSC, so could someone kindly tell you what the status of your
application is.<P>

<A NAME="310"></A><H2>Question 3.10: What if I have problems (such as a takeover) before my channel is added to X/W?</H2>
Because your channel is not technically a registered channel until
it is actually added to X or W, there is nothing that CSC or #cservice can
do to help you with channel problems at this point.  You need to talk to an
IRCOp, which you can find on #wasteland, and ask them if they will help you
out.<P>

<A NAME="311"></A><H2>Question 3.11: My channel is added, what do I do now?</H2>
Congratulations, you are now a channel manager.  The channel
manager's FAQ, which you will have received by email before now, will tell
you how to set up the channel and userlist.  Please read the manager's FAQ
thoroughly.<P>

<A NAME="312"></A><H2>Question 3.12: Can I register more than one channel?</H2>
Each user is allowed to register one channel.  They may, in addition
to this channel, register a help channel that provides assistance to users
for things such as: Software products, Internet services, Internet Service
Providers.  If you are unsure if you channel falls under this category,
email cservice@undernet.org and ask.  ("Each user" is defined as a person,
not as an email address.  If you have multiple email addresses, you may not
register multiple channels.  One channel, and optionally one help channel,
per person)

<A NAME="313"></A><H2>Question 3.13: What if I want to switch channel names?</H2>
Since the registration is for the channel, there is no provision for
changing channel names.  If you wish to do this, you must fill out a new
application for the new channel and submit it, following the normal
registration process.  At the top of your application, write a note saying
that your are the channel manager of #youroldchannel and would like to have
it purged from the registered channels list in order to register a different
channel.<P>

<HR>
<CENTER><H2>SECTION 4: Complaints and Channel Problems</H2></CENTER>

<A NAME="41"></A><H2>Question 4.1: How can I complain about X/W being on a channel?</H2>
If you think you have a valid reason why X/W should not be on a
registered channel (see <A HREF="42">4.2</A>), such as the manager is never
around, or it is a warez or child pornography channel, you can email your
complaint to <A HREF="mail:cservice@undernet.org">cservice@undernet.org</A>. 
If there is a lot of support for your complaint, please include the email
addresses and nicks of those who support you in your letter (do NOT have
everyone send a separate letter).  The CSC admins will evaluate your
complaint, and if it is valid, action will be taken.<P>

<A NAME="42"></A><H2>Question 4.2: I don't like the content of a channel with X/W on it, what can I do?</H2>
Because CSC does not consider content during the registration
process, excepting warez and child porn channels, there is nothing you can
do about this.  The CSC specifically disclaims responsibility for the
content of a channel, and the way the manager chooses to run the channel, as
it would be an overwhelming task for CSC to police every registered
channel.<P>

<A NAME="43"></A><H2>Question 4.3: I was kicked/banned from a channel with X/W on it for no reason, who can I complain to?</H2>
As stated in 4.2 above, the CSC has no reponsibility for, nor say
over how a manager, and those he gives operator status to, choose to run the
channel.  A channel operator can kick and/or ban someone for any reason they
choose, or no reason at all.  Therefore there is noone taht you can complain
to about this except the people who run that specific channel (the
manager).<P>

<A NAME="44"></A><H2>Question 4.4: I tried to deop/kick X/W, but I got this message that says I can't do that.  Why?</H2>
Because X and W are Undernet services that exist to provide
stability to registered channels, the Undernet and CSC admins have chosen to
modify the Undernet servers to make it so that X and W cannot be kicked or
deopped.  By doing this, the stability of registered channels is greatly
increased, and the load on the Undernet IRC network is decreased.  This
modification is in effect on some, but not all, Undernet servers at this
point in time.<P>

<A NAME="45"></A><H2>Question 4.5: I deopped/kicked X/W, why did people get on my case about doing that?</H2>
As stated in 4.4 above, X and W exist to provide channel stability. 
When they are deopped or kicked, their ability to maintain the channel is
disrupted, in addition to the fact that this places an extra load on the
Undernet network.  For this reason, these actions are responded to by CSC
admins and/or helpers so that it will not happen again.  If X/W is
repeatedly deopped and kicked on a channel, that channel can be removed from
the registered channels list, and X/W removed from the channel.<P>

<A NAME="46"></A><H2>Question 4.6: Admins/Helpers say that I deopped/kicked X/W, but I didn't!</H2>
If a CSC admin or helper comes onto a channel and says that you
kicked or deopped X/W, they are going to be right 99% of the time.  It is
possible that you are running scripts or remotes that have deopped or kicked
X/W without your knowledge.  If this is the case, explain to the admin or
helper that you did not deop/kick X/W consciously, and they will probably be
able to help you fix your script or remote so that it does not happen
again.<P>

<A NAME="47"></A><H2>Question 4.7: A CSC helper/admin was very rude to me, what can I do?</H2>
If you think an admin or helper was unnecessarily rude or abusive
towards you, please make sure you have a log of the incident.  Email this
log, and a note explaining the situation, to cservice@undernet.org.  The
admins will read and evaluate the situation, and respond accordingly.<P>

<CENTER><H2>SECTION 5: Getting More Help</H2></CENTER>

<A NAME="51"></A><H2>Question 5.1: How can I get help for X/W on IRC?</H2>
The CSC maintains a help channel on Undernet called #cservice. 
There are helpers and/or admins on this channel almost all the time. 
However, please make sure you have checked this FAQ, and the Op FAQ before
asking a question there.  If there is noone there to answer your question,
you can email it to <A
HREF="mail:cservice@undernet.org">cservice@undernet.org</A>.<P>

<A NAME="52"></A><H2>Question 5.2: How can I get a copy of the manager's FAQ?</H2>
The manager's FAQ is availible several ways:<UL>

ftp2.undernet.org</A>.</UL>

<A NAME="54"></A><H2>Question 5.4: Where are the CSC WWW pages?</H2>
CSC maintains 2 WWW pages, one for X, and one for W.  On these
pages, besides getting information about CSC and X/W, you can access channel
userlists, banlists, chaninfo, and perform a whois search on Undernet. 
These pages are located at:<UL>
<LI>X -- <A HREF="http://irc.ucdavis.edu:7357">http://irc.ucdavis.edu:7357</A>
<LI>W -- <A HREF="http://irc.wildstar.net:7357">http://irc.wildstar.net:7357</A></UL>

<A NAME="55"></A><H2>Question 5.5: What if I have other questions?</H2>
