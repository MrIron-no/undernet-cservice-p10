Undernet Channel Service (X)
Copyright (C) 1995-2002 Robin Thellend

This is the original Channel Service software that was used
on Undernet between 1995 and 2001.

For copying and licensing information, please see COPYING in
this directory.

This software is mostly obsolete now. It has been replaced
by GNUworld/CMaster, which can be found at:
http://gnuworld.sourceforge.net/

This software is unsupported, which means I have no intention
of ever releasing a new version. It is provided mainly for
educational and historical purposes.

Undernet ran this code on many different platforms, including
Solaris (sparc and x86), Linux, Freebsd, and OSF/1. As far as
I know, it should still compile and run fine on any of them with
a few minor adjustments.

However, I do NOT recommend using it in a production environment.

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

To compile:
  $ cp config.h.dist config.h
  $ vi config.h  # set everything correctly
  $ cp cs.conf.dist cs.conf
  $ vi cs.conf   # set everything correctly
  $ make

To run:
  $ ./cs -f cs.conf
